# StrinGen

StrinGen is an application that aims to facilitate the generation of NUS FASS ModReg strings (Boolean expressions) that specify module requirements. It generates a string based on the userâ€™s input into the GUI by adding parentheses and logical connectors. It also performs slight simplifications on the Boolean expression. While the application simplifies the string generation process through the GUI, the user still has to possess some knowledge of logical relationships and be careful when entering the requirements.
